## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb from 2016 to better understand:

1. Which month has the highest average listing price and listing total?
2. Which neighborhood has the highest average listing price and listing total?
3. How many new hosts are there in each year before 2016?
4. Does superhosts have higher average ratings?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

In the notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://orientsun6.medium.com/explore-the-seattle-airbnb-listing-data-cb79d19a9187).
